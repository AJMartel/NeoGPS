Data Model
==========
Rather than holding onto individual fields, the concept of a **fix** is used to group data members of the GPS acquisition.
This also facilitates the merging of separately received packets into a fused or coherent position.

The members of `gps_fix` include 

* fix status
* date
* time
* latitude and longitude
* altitude
* speed
* heading
* number of satellites
* horizontal, vertical and position dilutions of precision (HDOP, VDOP and PDOP)
* latitude, longitude and altitude error in centimeters

Constellation Information is also available in the GPS instance:
* satellite ID, azimuth, elevation and SNR

Except for `status`, each member is conditionally compiled; any, all, or *no* members can be selected for parsing, storing and fusing.  This allows configuring an application to use the minimum amount of RAM for the particular `fix` members of interest:

* Separate validity flag for each member.
* Integers are used for all members, retaining full precision of the original data.
* Optional floating-point accessors are provided.
* `operator |=` can be used to merge two fixes:
```
NMEAGPS gps_device;
gps_fix_t merged;
.
.
.
merged |= gps_device.fix();
```
